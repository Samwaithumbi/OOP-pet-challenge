# 🐶 Pet Simulator (Python OOP Project)

This is a simple object-oriented programming project in Python that simulates a virtual pet. The pet has attributes like hunger, energy, happiness, and can learn tricks!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

OOP (Classes, Methods, Encapsulation)

## 🧠 Features

- Track your pet's:
  - Hunger (0 = full, 10 = very hungry)
  - Energy (0 = tired, 10 = fully rested)
  - Happiness (0–10 scale)
- Perform actions:
  - `eat()` – Reduces hunger, boosts happiness
  - `sleep()` – Boosts energy
  - `play()` – Increases happiness and hunger, reduces energy
  - `train(trick)` – Teach your pet a new trick
  - `show_tricks()` – See all learned tricks
